# chessAI

You need to have Python installed on your system. The agent relies on two main Python libraries:

python-chess: This library handles the core chess game logic, including board representation, legal moves, and game state.

pygame: This library is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the chessboard.

Setup Instructions
Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, download and install the latest version from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install Required Libraries: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to install the necessary libraries:

pip install python-chess
pip install pygame

Play the Game:

A Pygame window will open, displaying the chessboard.

To move a piece: Click on one of your pieces (Black, as the AI is set to play White by default). Its legal moves will be highlighted. Then, click on the square where you want to move it.

The AI will automatically make its move after you complete yours.

Reset Board: Press the R key on your keyboard to reset the game to its starting position.

Undo Move: Press the Z key on your keyboard to undo the last move (and the AI's move if it just played).

Exit Game: Close the Pygame window by clicking the 'X' button or by pressing Ctrl+C in your terminal.
